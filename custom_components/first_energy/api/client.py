"""Async client for the 1st Energy private API.

Undocumented and reverse-engineered from browser traffic; 1st Energy may change
or withdraw it without notice. Every request carries both credential headers
(see `auth.py`) plus the browser-ish header set the portal sends — the CDR
`x-fapi-*` trio and the `sec-fetch-*` group. Drop-testing showed most of these
are unnecessary, but `origin` and `user-agent` were never tested in isolation
and the cost of keeping them is nil.

No Home Assistant imports: this module takes an `aiohttp.ClientSession` and
returns domain objects.
