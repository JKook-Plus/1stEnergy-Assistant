"""1st Energy API client.

Vendored inside the integration package because HACS copies only
`custom_components/<domain>/` onto the target system — a sibling library
would not be importable there without publishing it to PyPI first.

Nothing in this package or in `domain/` may import `homeassistant`. That rule
is what keeps the client independently testable and extractable later.
