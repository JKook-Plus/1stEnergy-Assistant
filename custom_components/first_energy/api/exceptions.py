"""
Author:     Hayden Foxwell
Purpose:
    Custom exceptions for the 1st Energy API client.

    A 401 from this API is ambiguous: the body is byte-identical for a missing
    bearer token, an expired token and a wrong password. The only way to tell
    them apart is the response headers — an application rejection carries
    `x-powered-by` / `x-v` / `api-supported-versions`, while a rejection at the
    Azure Front Door edge carries only `x-azure-ref`.

    This matters for Home Assistant. Raising ConfigEntryAuthFailed on an edge
    rejection would nag the user for their password every time the one-hour BFF
    token expires, which is routine rather than an error.
