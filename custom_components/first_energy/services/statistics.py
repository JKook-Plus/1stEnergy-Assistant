"""Collapse interval reads into the hourly buckets Home Assistant stores.

No Home Assistant imports — this is pure arithmetic over domain objects, so it
can be tested without spinning up a recorder.

Two decisions worth stating, because both are easy to get subtly wrong:

**Buckets are keyed on UTC hours.** Home Assistant's recorder stores long-term
statistics on UTC hour boundaries, so that is what we produce. It also sidesteps
two traps. On a daylight-saving "fall back" day the local hour 02:00 happens
twice; bucketing locally would merge two distinct hours into one and lose an
hour of consumption. And 1st Energy sells into South Australia, which sits at
UTC+9:30 — local hour boundaries there do not align with UTC ones at all.
Bucketing in UTC is correct in every jurisdiction; a 5-minute slot never
straddles a UTC hour boundary because 30 minutes divides evenly by 5.

**Timestamps advance in absolute time from local midnight.** Slot *i* starts at
`local_midnight + i * interval` measured as elapsed time, not as a naive clock
increment. On a transition day the clock jumps but elapsed time does not, so
the slots stay pinned to the right instants.
