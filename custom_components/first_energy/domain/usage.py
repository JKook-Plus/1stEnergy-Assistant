    The CDR endpoint returns three parallel arrays at the native meter

    cost in AUD, and the time-of-use band name. They are validated as
    equal-length at parse time, because downstream bucketing zips them and a
    silent length mismatch would misattribute cost to the wrong hour.

    `intervals` sums exactly to `energy_kwh`, and `costings` to `cost_aud` —
    verified across 39 days of real data with zero drift.
